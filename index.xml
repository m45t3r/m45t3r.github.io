      <description>Hi, my name is Thiago Kenji Okada. I have a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science and recently started working as a Software Developer.
My primary language of choice is Python, however I also have experience in Ruby and Javascript. I am also a advanced Linux user, with some experience in systems administration. I am always trying to learn new things.

      <description>I am starting a yet another blog, this time based on Hugo instead of Pelican or Jekyll.
I decided to use Hugo because it is fast, thanks to the fact that is written in Go. Even if this blog shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have too much content so that the compile times shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take too long, it is still nice to have sub-second compile times. And thanks to the static binaries that is used in Go applications, this makes much easier to deploy my blog.</description>
