      <description>This is a post that I wanted to write for a long time. The idea is to imagine how popular todays&amp;rsquo; most popular programming languages will be in 15 years.
15 years was chosen because it is quite a nice period of time: 10 years would be too soon so that the programming landscape wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change too much from what it is nowadays. 20 years is too long of a period to make any kind of precise foresight.</description>
